<p>Content stewards are the gatekeepers. They oversee all listings in Marketplace. Before listings are available for users to find and use, an organizational content steward and a Marketplace content steward must approve them.</p>

<h2>Define Content Steward Roles</h2>

<p><b>Marketplace content steward</b> &ndash; People with this role have two main functions. They must approve every listing in Marketplace and administer the system and enable or disable them. Administering the system includes making new Categories, etc., and sending notifications.</p>

<p><b>Organizational content steward</b> &ndash; Every organization has at least one organizational content steward or &ldquo;org steward.&rdquo; The org steward must approve listings before sending them to a Marketplace steward for final approval. Org stewards can approve listings or send them back to their owners for updates. Also, they can edit or delete reviews.</p>

<h2>Define Marketplace Manager</h2>

<p>The Marketplace Content Steward has two roles:</p>

<ol>
	<li><b pbzloc="538">Oversee <i>all</i> listings in Marketplace see FUTURE LINK</b>

	<ol>
		<li>Approve or reject listings</li>
		<li>Enable or disable listings</li>
		<li>Select which listings will be featured on the Search an Discovery Page using the <a href="#featureFlag">Feature Flag</a>.</li>
	</ol>

		<li>Send system-wide Notifications</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<h1><a id="Steward_listingManagementPage" name="Steward_listingManagementPage">Steward View</a>: Listing Management Page</h1>

<p>Org stewards can see every listing in their organization from their Listing Management page. To access this page, click the drop-down Main Menu on the right side of the Global Toolbar and select Listing Management:</p>

<p><img alt="Link to Listing Management Page from Global Toolbar" src="../ozp-help/Doc_images/ListingManagementLink.png" style="height: 320px; width: 200px" title="Listing Management Page" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a Marketplace or Content Steward, the Listing Management page&nbsp;displays information about listings you own and listings you oversee.&nbsp;For user instructions about the Listing Management page see&nbsp;the <a href="Marketplace.html##User_listingManagementPage">User View</a>: Listing Management Page.&nbsp;Also, Marketplace stewards can access system settings from the listings&#39; drop-down menus on this page.</p>

<p><img alt="Listing Management Page" src="../ozp-help/Doc_images/ListingManagementPage.png" style="height: 236px; width: 624px" title="Listing Management Page" /></p>

<p>The Listing Management page displays different information for different users. The following sections explain each field as it relates to a&nbsp;steward. For the user view see <a href="Marketplace.html##User_listingManagementPage">User View</a>: Listing Management Page.</p>

<h2>Steward View: Listing Management Page</h2>

<p>As a <b>steward</b>, you see multiple tabs on the Listing Management screen. The My Listings tab displays listings you own. The organizational tab(s) display listings that you oversee for a specific organization. All the organization&rsquo;s listings appear there. If you are the Marketplace Steward, all listings in the system appear under the Marketplace tab. The Recent Activity tab displays changes to all listings you oversee. The left-side State panel provides slightly different information than a user&rsquo;s left-side panel:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>All</b> &ndash; Listings you oversee as a steward</li>
	<li><b>Published</b> &ndash; Listings that are approved by Marketplace and organizational stewards within your organization (this number includes listings that are Disabled)</li>
	<li><b>Needs action</b> &ndash;Listing waiting for your approval. For instructions regarding approving or returning listings see FUTURE LINK: Manage Listings.</li>
	<li><b>(Pending) Org approved</b> &ndash; Listings waiting for Marketplace steward approval</li>
	<li><b>Returned</b> &ndash; Listings returned to their owners</li>
	<li><b>Draft</b> &ndash; Listings that you have not yet submitted for approval</li>
</ul>

<p>Marketplace Stewards also see an <b>Organization</b> filter on the left-side panel.</p>

<p>All stewards see the <b>Enabled</b> section which allows them to filter by Enabled and Disabled listings (For information about Enabled and Disabled listings see FUTURE LINK: Manage Listings)</p>

<p><b>Marketplace Settings</b> (only visible to Marketplace Stewards) is the home page for Marketplace management tools and all customizations administered within the user interface (as opposed to backend code). To learn more about Marketplace settings see FUTURE LINK: Marketplace Manager.<br />
<br />
<b>Metrics</b> can provide data about listing Web traffic and Marketplace. It is only visible to Marketplace stewards and must be configured by one of them.</p>
