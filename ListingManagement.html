<p>The Listing Management page displays different information for different users. The following sections explain each field as it relates to a user or steward.</p>

<h2 pbzloc="525">User View: Listing Management Page</h2>

<p>As a <strong>user</strong>, you see all the listings that you own (including active, disabled and draft listings); the Recent Activity tab describes changes to listings you own; and the State panel on the left side provides an overview on the status of your listings:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>All</strong> -- Listings you own in the system</li>
	<li><strong>Published</strong> -- Listings that are approved by Marketplace and organizational stewards in the system (this number includes listings that are Disabled)</li>
	<li><strong>Needs action</strong> -- Listings returned from a steward. To see the reason a listing was returned, click the arrow in the upper-right corner of the listing and select Read Feedback:<br />
	<img alt="Listing Action drop-down" src="../ozp-help/Doc_images/ListingAction_drop-down.png" style="height: 141px; width: 225px" title="Listing Action drop-down" /></li>
	<li><strong>Pending</strong> -- Listings waiting for approval from a steward</li>
	<li><strong>Draft</strong> -- Listings that you have not yet submitted for approval</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steward View: Listing Management Page</h2>

<p>As a <strong>steward</strong>, you see multiple tabs on the Listing Management screen. The My Listings tab displays listings you own. The organizational tab(s) display listings that you oversee for a specific organization. All the organization&rsquo;s listings appear there. If you are the Marketplace Steward, all listings in the system appear under the Marketplace tab. The Recent Activity tab displays changes to all listings you oversee. The left-side State panel provides slightly different information than a user&rsquo;s left-side panel:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>All</strong> &ndash; Listings you oversee as a steward</li>
	<li><strong>Published</strong> &ndash; Listings that are approved by Marketplace and organizational stewards within your organization (this number includes listings that are Disabled)</li>
	<li><strong>Needs action</strong> &ndash;Listing waiting for your approval. For instructions regarding approving or returning listings see FUTURE LINK: Manage Listings.</li>
	<li><strong>(Pending) Org approved</strong> &ndash; Listings waiting for Marketplace steward approval</li>
	<li><strong>Returned</strong> &ndash; Listings returned to their owners</li>
	<li><strong>Draft</strong> &ndash; Listings that you have not yet submitted for approval</li>
	<li>Marketplace Stewards also see an <strong>Organization</strong> filter on the left-side panel.</li>
	<li>All stewards see the <strong>Enabled</strong> section which allows them to filter by Enabled and Disabled listings (For information about Enabled and Disabled listings see FUTURE LINK: Manage Listings)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Marketplace Settings</strong> (only visible to Marketplace Stewards) is the home page for Marketplace management tools and all customizations administered within the user interface (as opposed to backend code). To learn more about Marketplace settings see FUTURE LINK: Marketplace Manager.<br />
<br />
<strong>Metrics</strong> can provide data about listing Web traffic and Marketplace. It is only visible to Marketplace stewards and must be configured by one of them.</p>
